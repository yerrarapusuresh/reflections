What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It's going to initilize the repository and we have to intimate to git so that it can keep track of the file commits. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

we cannot commit directley from working directory. once we added to staging area we can commit. its can keep track of which file is modified
