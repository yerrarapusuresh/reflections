was introduced?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  manual is great advantage : you can make chage when any logica bug has modified
  automatic is disadvantage : automatically saves version every time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
